This project is a Traffic Light Intersection Simulation created by Group 2 and Group 6 from BSIT 1-2. It offers an interactive experience where users can control and alter traffic lights at a simulated intersection.

Key features include:

An easy-to-navigate menu to start the simulation, view credits, or quit the application.
Real-time updates of traffic lights, reflecting user interactions.
Smooth visual transitions, such as fade-in effects when starting the simulation and fade-out effects when quitting.
A visually appealing interface with background videos and intuitive button designs.
The project is coded using Python, leveraging libraries like pygame for the graphical interface and cv2 for video background. 
This simulation not only provides a dynamic visualization of traffic control but also serves as an educational tool, showcasing how traffic lights can be managed and manipulated in real-time.
